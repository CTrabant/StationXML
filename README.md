# StationXML
The FDSN StationXML schema and related documents are maintained
by the [International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN)](http://www.fdsn.org/).

StationXML is a schema definition for representing the [Standard for the Exchange of Earthquake (SEED)](http://www.fdsn.org/seed_manual/SEEDManual_V2.4.pdf) metadata in XML.

SEED and StationXML are maintained by FDSN Working Group II.

## Releases

Approved releases are available from [http://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/](http://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/).

## Change procedure

Proposed additions to the schema should be created to a branch of
*master* and a pull request should be opened.  Once the addition
has been approved by the FDSN it will eventually merged with the
master branch and included in the next release.

For discussion of a potential change without creating a branch
an issue should be created.
